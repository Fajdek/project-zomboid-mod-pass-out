description=[h1]Notes:[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] The mod checks every 10 in-game minutes for updates
description=[*] Any panic will keep you awake while it is active, but each in-game minute reduces panic by 10 percentage points while passing out
description=[*] If you manage to eat enough vitamins to drop the tiredness Moodle below Level 4 for 10 in-game minutes, you will reset the timer (unlikely to happen)
